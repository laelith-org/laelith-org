## Laelith Trademark Usage Guidelines [Draft]

The LAELITH trademark is owned by [Laelith Foundation; later on, its successor Association - TBD by the Authors]; in all text that follows, the word Foundation refers to both the Laelith Foundation currently and its successor IP caretaker thereafter; the LAELITH trademark may be used under the following conditions:

- Nominative references ("compatible with Laelith," "based on Laelith," "for use with Laelith")
- Academic/critical discussion
- News reporting
- Commentary and reviews

### ✓ CONDITIONAL APPROVAL (requires compliance):

Prominent use in derivative works (e.g., "Laelith: [Your Title]" or "[Title]: A Laelith Adventure") is permitted if you:

**1. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:**

- Clearly credit the original Laelith creators: [list names or "Laelith Authors Guild"]
- Include statement: "Laelith is a trademark of the Laelith Foundation. This work is independently created under the Laelith Community Guidelines [link?]."
- Link to the authors on the Open Licence website: https://laelith.org/authors
- If adapting specific Laelith content, credit those specific authors

**2. QUALITY STANDARDS:**

- Work must be substantially complete (not abandoned/unfinished projects using the mark)
- Professional presentation appropriate to medium (doesn't need to be high-budget, but should show care)
- Functional if interactive (games/software must work as described)
- Accurate description (doesn't misrepresent content or scope)

**3. CLARITY OF RELATIONSHIP:**

- Must NOT suggest official endorsement by Foundation unless explicitly granted
- Must NOT claim to be "official Laelith" content unless approved by Foundation
- Recommended language: "This is an independent work by [creator] and is not officially endorsed by the Foundation"

**4. COMMUNITY STANDARDS:**

- Must respect the spirit and community values of Laelith
- Must not misrepresent or distort the core concepts of the Laelith IP

Benefits of certification:

- Use of official "Laelith Community Certified" badge

### ✗ PROHIBITED USES:
